🧠 Ultimate Tic Tac Toe — Game Rules Explained
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (also called Super Tic Tac Toe or Meta Tic Tac Toe) is a strategic, multi-level version of the classic game. It uses a 3×3 grid of 3×3 mini Tic Tac Toe boards — so 9 mini boards, forming a big 3×3 grid.

🎮 Objective:
Just like regular Tic Tac Toe, your goal is to get 3 in a row — but onz the large grid, not just one mini board.

🧱 Board Layout:
The full board is made of 9 mini boards.

Each mini board is a normal 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board.

Winning a mini board gives you control of that spot in the big board.

👟 How to Play:
Player X starts the game by playing in any of the 81 cells (one of the mini board's cells).

The position where Player X plays determines which mini board Player O must play in next.

For example: if Player X plays in the top-right cell (position [0][2]) of a mini board, then Player O must play in the top-right mini board.

Player O then picks a cell in that mini board, and the cycle continues — the position inside the current mini board directs where the next player plays.

If the target mini board is already won or full, the next player can choose any mini board.

🏆 Winning Mini Boards:
Just like regular Tic Tac Toe, you win a mini board by getting 3 in a row.

Once a mini board is won, it’s considered claimed by that player and is marked with an X or O.

🏁 Winning the Game:
The first player to win 3 mini boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the big board wins the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.

🛑 Special Rules:
Mini board is full: If a mini board is full but not won, it is a drawn board and no one can claim it. The next player may choose any board.

You must play where you're sent — unless that board is full/won.

💡 Strategy Tips:
Think 2 levels ahead — every move affects where your opponent plays.

Try to force your opponent into mini boards that benefit you.

Winning a mini board is important, but controlling the flow is even more critical.
