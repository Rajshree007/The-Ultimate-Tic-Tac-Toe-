    <h1 class="title">The Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <p class="intro">Welcome! This is not your usual Tic Tac Toe. It's smarter. It's trickier. It's more fun!</p>

    <h3>Game Setup:</h3>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>The game is played on a **3Ã—3 grid** of **9 smaller Tic Tac Toe boards**.</li>
      <li>Each smaller board is a regular 3Ã—3 Tic Tac Toe game.</li>
      <li>Your goal is to win **3 small boards in a row** â€” just like classic Tic Tac Toe, but on the big board!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Play:</h3>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>Player X starts by picking **any square** in **any of the 9 boards**.</li>
      <li>Letâ€™s say Player X picks the **top-left square** of a mini board â€” this sends Player O to the **top-left mini board** next.</li>
      <li>Then Player O plays in that specific board. Their move determines where Player X goes next.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Special Situations:</h3>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>If you are sent to a mini board that is **already full or won**, you are free to play **anywhere**.</li>
      <li>A mini board is won by getting **3 Xs or Os in a row** in that board â€” just like regular Tic Tac Toe.</li>
      <li>Once you win a mini board, it becomes **your mark (X or O)** on the big board.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Win:</h3>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>Win **3 mini boards in a row** â€” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally â€” on the big board.</li>
      <li>This makes you the winner of the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game!</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">ðŸ§  Think ahead. Plan your moves. Donâ€™t just win boards â€” control the flow!</p>
